# NextWordPrediction
This project is aimed to build a word predictor app that a user might want type next based on the likelihood of the words for following the pattern of already typed words. The likelihood of a word following the typed text has been learned from the news, blog and tweet data provided by the Swiftkey as a part of the capstone project on Coursera data science specialization.<br>
The prediction model is based on the word tokenization approach (n-gram tokenization) and has been developed using the Rweka package available in R. The prediction model is being the used by the web application for making the word suggestion and the web application is developed using the shiny package available in R.
